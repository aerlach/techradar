"Eclipse Tycho","hold","tools",FALSE,"Building Eclipse plug-ins with Apache Maven"
"OSGi","hold","languages & frameworks",FALSE,"OSGi (Open Service Gateway initiative) is a specification that aims to remedy the lack of a module system for Java, allowing for dynamic reloading of components."
"Gradle","adopt","tools",FALSE,"Build automation tool focused on flexibility and performance. Language-based build tools like Gradle and Rake continue to offer finer-grained abstractions and more flexibility long term than XML and plug-in based tools like Ant and Maven. This allows them to grow gracefully as projects become more complex."
"Jenkins","hold","tools",FALSE,""
"Subversion","hold","tools",FALSE,""
"Git","assess","tools",TRUE,"Git is a well architected, high performance implementation of distributed version control."
"Java","hold","languages & frameworks",FALSE,""
"Oracle PL/SQL","hold","languages & frameworks",FALSE,"PL/SQL lack expressiveness, is difficult to test, and discourages clean modular design. You should only consider stored procedures executing within the database engine in exceptional circumstances, where there is a proven performance issue."
"Eclipse RAP","hold","languages & frameworks",FALSE,""
"Apache Camel","hold","languages & frameworks",FALSE,""
"Apache OpenJPA","hold","languages & frameworks",FALSE,""
"Apache Tomcat","adopt","platforms",FALSE,""
"Domain-driven Design","assess","techniques",TRUE,""
"Event Storming","trial","techniques",TRUE,"Event Storming is a useful way to do rapid 'outside-in' domain modeling: starting with the events that occur in the domain rather than a static data model. Run as a facilitated workshop, it focuses on discovering key domain events, placing them along a timeline, identifying their triggers and then exploring their relationships."
"Event Sourcing","trial","techniques",TRUE,"Event sourcing is an approach to thinking about persistent data where the primary record is a log of all events that make updates. A traditional representation of database state can be entirely recreated by reprocessing this event log. Event sourcing’s benefits include strong auditing, creation of historic state, and replaying of events for debugging and analysis. Event sourcing has been around for a while, but we think it is used much less than it should be."
"DevOps","assess","techniques",TRUE,"The DevOps movement continues to gain traction as people pay more attention to the often-broken relationship between development and operations. DevOps promotes closer collaboration and joint responsibility between development and operations. DevOps applies agile practices to operations processes such as provisioning, change management and production monitoring and also brings productionlike thinking, tools and environments to development. DevOps is a key underpinning for organizations wanting to achieve continuous delivery of application releases into production."
"D3","hold","tools",FALSE,"D3 is a JavaScript library for binding datasets into the DOM, and then declaratively transforming the document to create rich visualizations."
"Elastic Search","hold","platforms",FALSE,"Elastic Search is an extensible, multi-tenanted, and horizontally scalable search solution based on Apache Lucene. It allows complex data structures to be indexed and retrieved through a JSON based REST API."
"Microservices","assess","techniques",TRUE,"Microservices, often deployed out-of-container or using an embedded HTTP server, are a move away from traditional large technical services. This approach trades benefits such as maintainability for additional operational complexity. These drawbacks are typically addressed using infrastructure automation and continuous deployment techniques. On balance, microservices are an effective way of managing technical debt and handling different scaling characteristics especially when deployed in a service oriented architecture built around business capabilities."
"OAuth","adopt","platforms",TRUE,"OAuth is a web-friendly, lightweight standard for authorization that allows a user to share private resources between internet services. OAuth is simple, avoids password proliferation, and allows a service to grant bare minimum privileges. If you are exposing your application’s data in a lightweight, web-friendly manner you should strongly consider using OAuth as your standard for authorization."
"OWASP Dependency-Check","trial","tools",TRUE,"In a world full of libraries and tools that simplify the life of many software developers, deficiencies in their security have become visible and have increased the vulnerability surface in the applications that use them. OWASP Dependency-Check automatically identifies potential security problems in the code, checking if there are any known publicly disclosed vulnerabilities, then using methods to constantly update the database of public vulnerabilities. Dependency-Check has some interfaces and plugins to automate this verification in Java."
"Rancher","hold","platforms",FALSE,"Rancher is an open source solution that allows deployment of containers into a cluster of machines, which is becoming an increasingly common scenario. It provides services such lifecycle management, monitoring, health checks and discovery. Also included is a completely containerized operating system based on Docker. The broad focus on containerization and very small footprint are key advantages for Rancher. A similar solution in this space is Kubernetes."
"SAFe™","assess","techniques",TRUE,"Scaled Agile Framework ..."
"Sonar","hold","tools",FALSE,"Sonar is an integrated tool for checking, tracking and visualizing those metrics. It not only combines metrics together, but also mixes them with historical measures, giving us a better insight into the internal quality of the codebase."
"Spring Boot","trial","languages & frameworks",FALSE,"
Spring Boot allows easy set up of standalone Spring-based applications. It's ideal for pulling up new microservices and easy to deploy. It also makes data access less of a pain due to the JPA mappings with much less boilerplate code."
"Swagger","trial","tools",FALSE,"Swagger is a standard way to describe a RESTful API so that documentation and client examples can be generated automatically."
